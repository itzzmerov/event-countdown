# ⏳ Simple Event Countdown Timer

**Simple Event Countdown** is a clean and minimal static website that displays a real-time countdown for a specific event.  
This project was designed in **Figma** and converted into a functional website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It serves as a **sneak peek** of my upcoming project **“Event-ick”**, where users will be able to create, share, and discover public events with live countdowns.
